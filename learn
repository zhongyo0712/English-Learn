Okay, Roger! Understood. It's been a good session today.

Here's your feedback report based on our conversation:

**Feedback Report for Roger**

**1. Common Grammatical Mistakes During Our Chat:**

*   **Verb Tense & Subject-Verb Agreement:** We worked on ensuring verbs match the subject (e.g., "it take**s**") and using the correct tense for the context (e.g., "I **made** a mistake" instead of "I make").
*   **Use of Articles (a/an/the):** We noted a few instances where articles were missing or could be added for naturalness (e.g., "watch **the** NBA," "a bad atmosphere," "in **the** past").
*   **Prepositions:** There were several places where we adjusted prepositions for correct usage (e.g., "express *in* a sentence," "difficult *for me*," "think *about* it," "study *in* Taiwan").
*   **Word Forms (Adjective/Adverb/Noun/Verb):** We adjusted words to their correct form in the sentence (e.g., "I am **worried**" (adjective) vs. "I worry" (verb); "work... **temporarily**" (adverb)).
*   **Plurals:** Ensuring nouns are plural when referring to multiple items (e.g., "simple sentence**s**," "Chinese sentence**s**," "bad experience**s**").
*   **Gerunds vs. Infinitives:** We clarified when to use the "-ing" form (gerund) or the "to + verb" form (infinitive) (e.g., "want **to use**," "like **creating**").
*   **Natural Phrasing & Vocabulary Choice:** We often refined sentences to sound more natural or used more common vocabulary (e.g., "short man" for height instead of "small man," "future prospects" instead of "futurity," "emigrate abroad" instead of "emigrating to board").
*   **Embedded Question Word Order:** Correcting word order when a question is part of a larger statement (e.g., "worried about what jobs **I should** do").
